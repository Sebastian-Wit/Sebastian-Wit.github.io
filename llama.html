        Llamas are domesticated camelids that are native to the Andes 
        Mountains in South America. They are often used for transportation, 
        as pack animals for carrying goods, and as a source of wool for 
        textiles. Llamas have a distinctive appearance, with long necks, 
        banana-shaped ears, and a thick, woolly coat that can come in a 
        variety of colors. They are social animals that live in herds and 
        have a gentle disposition, often making them popular as pets and 
        for use in animal-assisted therapy. Llamas are also known for their 
        ability to spit, which they do as a means of communication and defense. 
        Despite their popularity, llamas are currently facing threats from habitat 
        loss, hunting, and competition with introduced livestock species. Llamas 
        are fascinating animals and have been an important part of Andean culture 
        and history for thousands of years.
