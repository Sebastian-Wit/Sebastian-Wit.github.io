        Camels are large, hoofed mammals that are well-adapted to 
        living in desert environments. They are known for their humps, 
        which are used to store fat that can be used for energy when 
        food and water are scarce. Camels are also able to conserve 
        water and withstand high temperatures, making them well-suited 
        to life in arid regions. They are often used by humans for 
        transportation, as their ability to travel long distances without 
        water makes them ideal for desert travel. Camels have long been 
        domesticated, and there are two main species: the dromedary or 
        Arabian camel, which has one hump, and the Bactrian camel, which 
        has two humps. Camels are iconic animals of the desert and have 
        been an important part of the culture and economies of many 
        countries throughout history.
