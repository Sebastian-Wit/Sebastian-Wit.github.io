        Monkeys are a diverse group of primates that are found throughout 
        the world, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. There 
        are over 250 species of monkeys, which range in size from the tiny 
        pygmy marmoset, which weighs less than a pound, to the large mandrill, 
        which can weigh over 100 pounds. Monkeys have opposable thumbs, which 
        allow them to grasp and manipulate objects, and they are known for their 
        intelligence and social behavior. Some species, such as baboons and macaques, 
        live in large groups with complex social structures, while others, such as 
        orangutans, are more solitary. Monkeys are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, 
        including fruit, insects, and small animals. Unfortunately, many species of 
        monkeys are currently facing threats from habitat loss, hunting, and the pet 
        trade. Monkeys are fascinating animals that have captured the imagination of 
        humans for centuries, and they continue to be the subject of study and conservation 
        efforts.
