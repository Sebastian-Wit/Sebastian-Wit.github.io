        Giraffes are the tallest living land animals and are known for 
        their long necks, which can be over 6 feet (2 meters) long. 
        They are native to the African continent and can be found in 
        savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Giraffes are herbivores 
        and primarily eat leaves, flowers, and fruits. They have unique 
        spotted patterns on their skin, which helps them blend into their 
        environment and avoid predators. Male giraffes use their long necks 
        to engage in necking fights, where they swing their necks and heads 
        at each other in contests for dominance. Giraffes are social animals 
        and live in groups called towers, which can consist of up to 20 
        individuals. Unfortunately, giraffes are currently facing threats from 
        habitat loss and poaching, and their populations have declined by over 
        40% in the past few decades. Giraffes are iconic animals and have been 
        the subject of fascination and study by humans for centuries.
